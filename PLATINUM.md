**Start date**: 10th October 2020

The last time I played this game was in 2010. So it's been well over a decade. It's a really hard game compared to the newer generations. I struggled to get from the first town to the second town. You really need to keep stocked up on potions. Also, getting EXP is much harder. I am really enjoying the grind though, and I am taking my time with the story as I don't remember much from my play through beforehand.

### Rare event Pokemon

I used the [DNS glitch](https://www.shacknews.com/article/108512/how-to-unlock-gen-4-and-5-pokemon-mystery-events-in-2018) to simulate the special events for this game. I do not consider it cheating as I am not hacking the Pokemon into my system, I am merely accessing a DNS server distributing the Pokemon to me. There is also some randomness in which gifts you get, so it's not easy to just get the ones you want. It is really hard to get this glitch to work due to the way Platinum and Gen 4 games handle WIFI connectivity. My tweet below outlines the method I used, which requires a Linux laptop.
