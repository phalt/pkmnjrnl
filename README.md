## Where did I start?

I think I was nine, maybe ten years old. Perfect considering the main character of the game is around that age when they start their adventure.

By this point my parents had split up, so my Dad was picking me up for a weekend stay.
My birthday is September 13th, and I know that Pokemon Red/Blue was available October 5th 1999, so it must have been a few weeks after my birthday.
Dad had bought me a copy of Pokemon Blue and a blue [Gameboy pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy#Game_Boy_Pocket). I think the Gameboy was secondhand, but the game was definitely new.

This wasn't my first exposure to Pokemon though. I was into video games, I owned a PlayStation with [A Bug's Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life_(video_game)), that had come out in February 1999. So that means between February and October I had bought and read various magazines and I remember a Nintendo magazine giving away a free Pokemon card, a [Charmander base set 46](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charmander_(Base_Set_46)). I have an odd feeling every time I see this card. I distinctly remember reading the text over and over, and being curious about this word "Pokemon". I have searched high and low to find the exact magazine that I got this card in, and I can't find it.

It was in either 1998 or 1999, and it must have been a magazine for Nintendo or trading cards (I know TopDeck was a magazine for Wizards of the Coast back then), and I was into Magic: The Gathering just before I found out about Pokemon.

## Pokemon TCG

### 2011-2013

My first foray into the world of competitive TCG was during the Black & White era. EX cards were just coming out in Noble Victories, MewTwo EX was dominating all the tournaments. My most sort-after card during this time was a [Darkrai EX full art](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/dex/107/), which I managed to pull from a random pack! I also remember having a [Chandelure secret rare](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/nxd/101/).

Unfortunately, I was leaving university and became ashamed of my Pokemon hobby, so I threw all my cards in the rubbish. It was the most stupid mistake of my life (probably).

I was just starting to get good, as well (as evidenced with my win record below)
