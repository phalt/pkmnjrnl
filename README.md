## Pokemon TCG

### 2011-2013

My first foray into the world of competitive TCG was during the Black & White era. EX cards were just coming out in Noble Victories, MewTwo EX was dominating all the tournaments. My most sort-after card during this time was a [Darkrai EX full art](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/dex/107/), which I managed to pull from a random pack! I also remember having a [Chandelure secret rare](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/nxd/101/).

Unfortunately, I was leaving university and became ashamed of my Pokemon hobby, so I threw all my cards in the rubbish. It was the most stupid mistake of my life (probably).

I was just starting to get good, as well (as evidenced with my win record below)
